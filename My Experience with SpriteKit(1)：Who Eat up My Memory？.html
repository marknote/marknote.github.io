        <h1>My Experience with SpriteKit(1)：Who Eat up My Memory？</h1><p>tags:Thoughts<br/></p>
<p>Once upon a time I said I would create games. So I did.<br/>Swift is the future of iOS development，so this time I chose to code in Swift instead of OC. I had some experience coding Swift before, so working with Swift is not so challenges for me.<br/>Considering XCode has good builtin support to SpriteKit, I decided to build my first game with SpriteKit. While working with SpriteKit is not so smooth. So many problems I met.<br/>Today, I will tell you one of the stories.<br/>When I conducted load testing with my game( playing hard with my game), I found the game would run slower and slower.<br/>I immediately started to inspect this problem. It is really eye opener to me:<br/></p>
<p><img src="http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1113197-b9e8d8198eab1902.jpg?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240" alt="memory.jpg" /><br/></p>
<p>Oh my god! The memory usage keeps increasing itself, even the game paused.<br/>Where is my memory?<br/>I started to seek the memory lost. I carefully checked wherever objects are created, to ensure they will be released properly after usage.<br/>Based on my previous experience, memory leak usually happens with objects put into collections... While no luck  after 2 days hard work, unless finding that, the memory happens somewhere insider some SpriteKit event loop, and seems nothing to do with my code.<br/>So I was forced to choose my killer solution. I seldom use this killer solution, because, the solution is effective, while it will make my life so hard every time.<br/>The solution is to comment out code line by line.<br/>The solution was so great that I felt so hard from beginning to use it. While finally it really helped me.<br/>My code in ViewController is like below:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-swift">

override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  
  if let scene = GameScene(fileNamed:"GameScene") {
   // Configure the view.
   let skView = self.view as! SKView
   #if (arch(i386) || arch(x86_64))
    skView.showsFPS = true
    skView.showsNodeCount = true
   #else
    skView.showsFPS = false
    skView.showsNodeCount = false
   #endif
   
   skView.showsPhysics = true
   skView.ignoresSiblingOrder = true   
   scene.scaleMode = .AspectFill
   skView.presentScene(scene)
  }
 }</pre>
<p>Magically I found when I commented out the line below, the memory leak stopped:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-swift">

skView.showsPhysics = true</pre>
<p>I could not imagine why  <strong>showsPhysics</strong> will eating up my memory.<br/>After googling, I found many people meet this problem, like the question raised here:<br/>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34846482/memory-leak-for-showsphysics<br/>Obviously this is a big bug with SpriteKit.<br/>While who will know this is the truth?<br/>Well, I spent 3 days of my precious life on this boring problem.<br/>If you happen to read my article, it might help to save you 3 days. It is really a good deal for you :)</p>
